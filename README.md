# **Flask website**

You can use this Flask-based website to extract images from YouTube videos as well as from videos on your computer. Moreover, you can also test your CNN models using the ".h5" file of your model. Currently, it only works with models created using Keras.



## creating the virtual environment

Before running "app.py," I recommend creating a virtual environment. You can do this by using the following snippets:


> ```powershell
> python -m venv .venv
> ```

> ```powershell
> .venv/Scripts/activate
> ```

> ```powershell
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
